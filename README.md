Getting Started
========================

This theme uses LESS to make full use of Bootstrap's features and avoid polluting markup with presentation classes, you need to be familiar with LESS to use it to its full power.

Note: This is still a work in progress, important functionality might be broken/missing. Please report any bugs you encounter.

Instructions
========================
* Use `bower install` to install dependencies.

* Executing `:set_value('no_frames','1')` in OcCLE to disable in-page iframes is advised as they don't play well with responsive CSS.

Screenshots
========================
Coming soon.

Browser Support
